Who goes there?\\nARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!\\nSOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!\\nARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.\\nSOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?\\nARTHUR: Yes!\\nSOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!\\nARTHUR: What?\\nSOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.\\nARTHUR: So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--\\nSOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconuts?\\nARTHUR: We found them.\\nSOLDIER #1: Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!\\nARTHUR: What do you mean?\\nSOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.\\nARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?\\nSOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?\\nARTHUR: Not at all.  They could be carried.\\nSOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?\\nARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!\\nSOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.\\nARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.\\nSOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?\\nARTHUR: Please!\\nSOLDIER #1: Am I right?\\nARTHUR: I'm not interested!\\nSOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!\\nSOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That's my point.\\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.\\nARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!\\nSOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.\\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah...\\nSOLDIER #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...  [clop clop clop] \\nSOLDIER #2: Wait a minute!  Supposing two swallows carried it together?\\nSOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line.\\nSOLDIER #2: Well, simple!  They'd just use a strand of creeper!\\nSOLDIER #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?\\nSOLDIER #2: Well, why not?\\nSCENE 2: [thud] [clang] \\nCART-MASTER: Bring out your dead!

He's very ill.\\nDEAD PERSON: I'm getting better!  \\nCUSTOMER: No you're not.  You'll be stone dead in a moment.\\nCART-MASTER: Oh, I can't take him like that.  It's against regulations.\\nDEAD PERSON: I don't want to go on the cart!\\nCUSTOMER: Oh, don't be such a baby.\\nCART-MASTER: I can't take him.\\nDEAD PERSON: I feel fine!\\nCUSTOMER: Well, do us a favor.\\nCART-MASTER: I can't.\\nCUSTOMER: Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes?  He won't be long.\\nCART-MASTER: No, I've got to go to the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.\\nCUSTOMER: Well, when's your next round?\\nCART-MASTER: Thursday.\\nDEAD PERSON: I think I'll go for a walk.\\nCUSTOMER: You're not fooling anyone you know.  Look, isn't there something you can do?\\nDEAD PERSON: [singing] I feel happy...  I feel happy.  [whop] \\nCUSTOMER: Ah, thanks very much.\\nCART-MASTER: Not at all.  See you on Thursday.\\nCUSTOMER: Right.  All right.  [howl] [clop clop clop] Who's that then?\\nCART-MASTER: I dunno.  Must be a king.\\nCUSTOMER: Why?\\nCART-MASTER: He hasn't got shit all over him.\\nSCENE 3: [thud] [King Arthur music] [thud thud thud] [King Arthur music stops] \\nARTHUR: Old woman!\\nDENNIS: Man!\\nARTHUR: Man.  Sorry.  What knight live in that castle over there?\\nDENNIS: I'm thirty-seven.\\nARTHUR: I-- what?\\nDENNIS: I'm thirty-seven.  I'm not old.\\nARTHUR: Well, I can't just call you 'Man'.\\nDENNIS: Well, you could say 'Dennis'.\\nARTHUR: Well, I didn't know you were called 'Dennis'.\\nDENNIS: Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?\\nARTHUR: I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the behind you looked--\\nDENNIS: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior!\\nARTHUR: Well, I am king!\\nDENNIS: Oh king, eh, very nice.  And how d'you get that, eh?  By exploiting the workers!  By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.  If there's ever going to be any progress with the--\\nWOMAN: Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh!  How d'you do?\\nARTHUR: How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.  Who's castle is that?\\nWOMAN: King of the who?\\nARTHUR: The Britons.\\nWOMAN: Who are the Britons?\\nARTHUR: Well, we all are.  We are all Britons, and I am your king.\\nWOMAN: I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous collective.\\nDENNIS: You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.  A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--\\nWOMAN: Oh, there you go, bringing class into it again.\\nDENNIS: That's what it's all about.  If only people would hear of--\\nARTHUR: Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives in that castle?\\nWOMAN: No one live there.\\nARTHUR: Then who is your lord?\\nWOMAN: We don't have a lord.\\nARTHUR: What?\\nDENNIS: I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.\\nARTHUR: Yes.\\nDENNIS: But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting--\\nARTHUR: Yes, I see.\\nDENNIS: By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--\\nARTHUR: Be quiet!\\nDENNIS: But by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major--\\nARTHUR: Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!\\nWOMAN: Order, eh?  Who does he think he is?  Heh.\\nARTHUR: I am your king!\\nWOMAN: Well, I didn't vote for you.\\nARTHUR: You don't vote for kings.\\nWOMAN: Well, how did you become king then?\\nARTHUR: The Lady of the Lake, ... [angels sing] ... her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. [singing stops] That is why I am your king!\\nDENNIS: Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.\\nARTHUR: Be quiet!\\nDENNIS: Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!\\nARTHUR: Shut up!\\nDENNIS: I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!\\nARTHUR: Shut up, will you.  Shut up!\\nDENNIS: Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.\\nARTHUR: Shut up!\\nDENNIS: Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!  Help, help!  I'm being repressed!\\nARTHUR: Bloody peasant!\\nDENNIS: Oh, what a give-away.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that, eh?  That's what I'm on about.  Did you see him repressing me?  You saw it, didn't you\\nSCENE 4: [King Arthur music] [music stops] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Aaagh!  [King Arthur music] [music stops] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Aaagh!\\nGREEN KNIGHT: Ooh!

You've got no arms left.\\nBLACK KNIGHT: Yes I have.\\nARTHUR: Look!\\nBLACK KNIGHT: Just a flesh wound. [kick] \\nARTHUR: Look, stop that.\\nBLACK KNIGHT: Chicken! [kick] Chickennn!\\nARTHUR: Look, I'll have your leg. [kick] Right! [whop] [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right leg off] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Right.  I'll do you for that!\\nARTHUR: You'll what?\\nBLACK KNIGHT: Come here!\\nARTHUR: What are you going to do, bleed on me?\\nBLACK KNIGHT: I'm invincible!\\nARTHUR: You're a looney.\\nBLACK KNIGHT: The Black Knight always triumphs!  Have at you!  Come on then. [whop] [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's last leg off] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Ooh.  All right, we'll call it a draw.\\nARTHUR: Come, Patsy.\\nBLACK KNIGHT: Oh.  Oh, I see.

I would be honored.\\nARTHUR: What is your name?\\nBEDEVERE: Bedevere, my liege.\\nARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table\\nNARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Gallahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table\\nSCENE 6: [clop clop clop] \\nSIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.\\nARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.\\nBEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir.\\nSIR LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege! [trumpets] \\nARTHUR: Camelot!\\nSIR GALAHAD: Camelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Camelot!\\nPATSY: It's only a model.\\nARTHUR: Shh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to...  Camelot! [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [singing] We're knights of the round table.  We dance when e'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We're knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] \\nPRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot.\\nMAN: I have to push the pram a lot [outdoors] \\nARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.\\nKNIGHTS: Right.  Right\\nSCENE 7: [clop clop clop] [boom boom] [angels sing] \\nGOD: Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel! [singing stops] One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.\\nARTHUR: Sorry. [boom] \\nGOD: And don't apologise.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. [boom] What are you doing now?!\\nARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.\\nGOD: Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now knock it off!\\nARTHUR: Yes, Lord.\\nGOD: Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.\\nARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord!\\nGOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold! [angels sing] Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.  That is your purpose, Arthur...  the quest for the Holy Grail. [boom] [singing stops] \\nLAUNCELOT: A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord!\\nGALAHAD: God be praised\\nSCENE 8: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] \\nARTHUR: Halt! [horn] Hallo! [pause] Hallo!\\nFRENCH GUARD: Allo!  Who is eet?\\nARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this?\\nFRENCH GUARD: This is the castle of my master Guy de Loimbard.\\nARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.\\nFRENCH GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.  Uh, he's already got one, you see?\\nARTHUR: What?\\nGALAHAD: He says they've already got one!\\nARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a.  (I told him we already got one.)\\nARTHUR: Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Of course not!  You are English types-a!\\nARTHUR: Well, what are you then?\\nFRENCH GUARD: I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!\\nGALAHAD: What are you doing in England?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Mind your own business!\\nARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!\\nFRENCH GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets.  Thpppppt!  Thppt! Thppt!\\nGALAHAD: What a strange person.\\nARTHUR: Now look here, my good man--\\nFRENCH GUARD: I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!\\nGALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to?\\nFRENCH GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a! [sniff] \\nARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.\\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache.)\\nOTHER FRENCH GUARD: Quoi?\\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache!) [mooo] \\nARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- [twong] [mooooooo] Jesus Christ!\\nKNIGHTS: Christ! [thud] Ah!  Ohh!\\nARTHUR: Right!  Charge!\\nKNIGHTS: Charge!

Haw haw heh..\\nSCENE 9: [clack] \\nVOICE: Picture for Schools, take eight.\\nDIRECTOR: Action!\\nHISTORIAN: Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.  The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--\\nKNIGHT: Aaaah! [slash] [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN] \\nHISTORIAN'S WIFE: Frank\\nSCENE 10: [trumpets] \\nNARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.  So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!\\nHis head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen--\\nSIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads.  Heh.  Looks like there's dirty work afoot.\\nDENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.\\nWOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  We haven't got enough mud.\\nALL HEADS: Halt!

Oh, quick!  Get the sword out.  I want to cut his headoff!\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off!\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor!\\nLEFT HEAD: What?\\nRIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky.  You're not next to him.\\nLEFT HEAD: What do you mean?\\nMIDDLE HEAD: You snore!\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, I don't.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well it's only because you don't brush my teeth.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, not biscuits.\\nLEFT HEAD: All right.  All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway.\\nALL HEADS: Right!\\nMIDDLE HEAD: He buggered off.\\nRIGHT HEAD: So he has.

Open the door! [pound pound pound] In the name of King Arthur, open the door! [squeak] [thump] [squeak] [boom] \\nGIRLS: Hello!\\nZOOT: Welcome gentle Sir Knight.  Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.\\nGALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?\\nZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it's not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!\\nGALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?\\nZOOT: The what?\\nGALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here.\\nZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper!\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot?\\nZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ...\\nZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.\\nGALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?\\nGALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste.\\nZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come.\\nGALAHAD: Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!\\nZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious.\\nGALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this--\\nZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.\\nGALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!\\nGALAHAD: No, no-- it's-- it's nothing.\\nZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] \\nPIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?\\nGALAHAD: They're doctors?!\\nZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.\\nGALAHAD: B-- but--\\nZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art.\\nWINSTON: Try to relax.\\nGALAHAD: Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?\\nPIGLET: We must examine you.\\nGALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that!\\nPIGLET: Please.  We are doctors.\\nGALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity.\\nPIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once!\\nGALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail!\\nPIGLET: There's no grail here.\\nGALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen--\\nGIRLS: Hello.\\nGALAHAD: Oh.\\nGIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

I have seen it, here in this castle!\\nDINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!\\nGALAHAD: Well, what is it?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the first time we've had this problem.\\nGALAHAD: It's not the real Grail?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad.  It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.\\nLEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually.\\nDENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.\\nOLD MAN: Get on with it.\\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it!\\nARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it!\\nDINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene.\\nGOD: Get on with it!\\nDINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!\\nDINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.\\nAMAZING: And spank me.\\nSTUNNER: And me.\\nLOVELY: And me.\\nDINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight!\\nDINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.\\nGIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex!\\nGALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer.\\nLAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, hello.\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: What?\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Why?\\nLAUNCELOT: You are in great peril!\\nDINGO: No he isn't.\\nLAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!\\nGALAHAD: You know, she's got a point.\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape!\\nGALAHAD: Look, I'm fine!\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!\\nGIRLS: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!\\nDINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nGIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nLAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily.\\nDINGO: Oh, yes.  Let him handle us easily.\\nGIRLS: Yes.  Let him handle us easily.\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  Quick!  Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Please!  I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred-and-fifty of them!\\nDINGO: Yes, yes!  He will beat us easily!  We haven't a chance.\\nGIRLS: We haven't a chance.  He will beat us easily... [boom] \\nDINGO: Oh, shit.\\nLAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.\\nGALAHAD: I don't think I was.\\nLAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril.\\nGALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous.\\nGALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  It's unhealthy.\\nGALAHAD: I bet you're gay.\\nLAUNCELOT: No I'm not\\nNARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--\\nCROWD: Get on with it!\\nNARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh\\nSCENE 12:\\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!

Where is the Grail?!\\nOLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.\\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?\\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee hee hee hee!  Ha ha ha ha ha!

All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land!  This'll be your kingdom, lad.\\nHERBERT: But Mother--\\nFATHER: Father, lad.  Father.\\nHERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.\\nFATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.\\nHERBERT: But I don't want any of that.  I'd rather--\\nFATHER: Rather what?!\\nHERBERT: I'd rather... [music] ... just...  sing!\\nFATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  You're not going into a song while I'm here.  Now listen, lad.

You put your sword right through his head!\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right?\\nFATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--\\nFATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?\\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.\\nFATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.

Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.\\nGUESTS: Oh!  Oh no!\\nFATHER: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He's not quite dead!\\nFATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He's getting better!\\nFATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.\\nBRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh!\\nGUEST #2: Oh, he's died!\\nFATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap] And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of Camelot--\\nLAUNCELOT: What?\\nGUEST #2: Look!  The dead Prince!\\nGUESTS: Oooh!  The dead Prince!\\nCONCORDE: He's not quite dead.\\nHERBERT: No, I feel much better.\\nFATHER: You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep!\\nHERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute.\\nFATHER: How?!\\nHERBERT: Well, I'll tell you.

We have no shrubberies here.\\nARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say...  we will say...  'ni'.\\nCRONE: Agh!  Do your worst!\\nARTHUR: Very well!

There is a pestilence upon this land.  Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.\\nARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'?\\nROGER: Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.\\nBEDEVERE: Ni!\\nARTHUR: No!  No, no, no!  No\\nSCENE 19:\\nARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we go now?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.  But there is one small problem.\\nARTHUR: What is that?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: We are now...  no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Shh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Shh!  We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv'.\\nRANDOM: Ni!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.\\nARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently Said 'Ni'?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find...  another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!\\nRANDOM: Ni!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: A path!  A path!  A path!  Ni!  Shh!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Shh!  Shh! ...\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...  with...  a herring!

Ohh!  Don't say that word.\\nARTHUR: What word?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.\\nARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: You said it again!\\nARTHUR: What, 'is'?\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Agh!  No, not 'is'.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'.  You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'.  Not 'is'.\\nBEDEVERE: My liege, it's Sir Robin!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Packing it in and packing it up, And sneaking away and buggering up, And chickening out and pissing off home, Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge.\\nARTHUR: Sir Robin!\\nROBIN: My liege!  It's good to see you.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Now he's said the word!  \\nARTHUR: Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?\\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is sneaking away and buggering up--\\nROBIN: Shut up!  No, no.  No.  Far from it.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nROBIN: I was looking for it.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nROBIN: Uh, here-- here in this forest.\\nARTHUR: No, it is far from this place.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!  The word...\\nARTHUR: Oh, stop it!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: ... we cannot hear!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Ow!  He said it again!\\nARTHUR: Patsy!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Wait!  I said it!  I said it! [clop clop clop] Ooh!  I said it again!  And there again!  That's three 'it's!  Ohh!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh\\nNARRATOR: And so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.  Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.\\nKNIGHTS: Yay!  Yay! [woosh] \\nNARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.\\nMINSTREL: [high-pitched] Get back!  Eee!\\nNARRATOR: And there was much rejoicing.\\nKNIGHTS: Yay!\\nNARRATOR: A year passed.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: [shivering] \\nNARRATOR: Winter changed into Spring.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Mmm, nice.\\nNARRATOR: Spring changed into Summer.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Oh.

Tim?\\nARTHUR: Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.\\nTIM: Greetings, King Arthur!\\nARTHUR: You know my name?\\nTIM: I do. [zoosh] You seek the Holy Grail!\\nARTHUR: That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden, O Tim.\\nTIM: Quite. [pweeng boom] [clap clap clap] \\nROBIN: Oh.\\nARTHUR: Yes, we're-- we're looking for the Holy Grail.  Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.\\nKNIGHTS: Yeah.  Yes.  It is.  It is.  Yeah.  Yup.  Yup.

[boom pweeng boom boom] \\nARTHUR: Look, um, you're a busy man, uh--\\nTIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.\\nKNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.  Oh...\\nTIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.\\nARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?\\nTIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.\\nARTHUR: What an eccentric performance\\nSCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] \\nGALAHAD: They're nervous, sire.\\nARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.  Dis-mount!\\nTIM: Behold the cave of Caerbannog!\\nARTHUR: Right!  Keep me covered.\\nGALAHAD: What with?\\nARTHUR: W-- just keep me covered.\\nTIM: Too late!

Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?  Well, it's always the same.  I always tell them--\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up!\\nTIM: Do they listen to me?\\nARTHUR: Right!\\nTIM: Oh, no...\\nKNIGHTS: Charge!

How many did we lose?\\nLAUNCELOT: Gawain.\\nGALAHAD: Ector.\\nARTHUR: And Bors.  That's five.\\nGALAHAD: Three, sir.\\nARTHUR: Three.  Three.  And we'd better not risk another frontal assault.  That rabbit's dynamite.\\nROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.\\nGALAHAD: Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.\\nARTHUR: Like what?\\nGALAHAD: Well...  ooh.\\nLAUNCELOT: Have we got bows?\\nARTHUR: No.\\nLAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.\\nARTHUR: Yes, of course!  The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch!  'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him!  Brother Maynard!  Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!\\nMONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, donaeis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eisrequiem.\\nARTHUR: How does it, um-- how does it work?\\nLAUNCELOT: I know not, my liege.\\nARTHUR: Consult the Book of Armaments!\\nBROTHER MAYNARD: Armaments, Chapter Two, verses Nine to Twenty-one.\\nSECOND BROTHER: And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu--\\nMAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother.\\nSECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.'\\nMAYNARD: Amen.\\nKNIGHTS: Amen.\\nARTHUR: Right!  One...  two...  five!\\nGALAHAD: Three, sir!\\nARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom] \\nSCENE 22:\\nARTHUR: There!  Look!\\nLAUNCELOT: What does it say?\\nGALAHAD: What language is that?\\nARTHUR: Brother Maynard!  You are a scholar.\\nMAYNARD: It's Aramaic!\\nGALAHAD: Of course!  Joseph of Arimathea!\\nLAUNCELOT: 'Course!\\nARTHUR: What does it say?\\nMAYNARD: It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh'.\\nARTHUR: What?\\nMAYNARD: '...  the Castle of uuggggggh'.\\nBEDEVERE: What is that?\\nMAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!\\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what it says.\\nARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.  He'd just say it!\\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what's carved in the rock!\\nGALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?\\nMAYNARD: No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'.\\nLAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh.\\nARTHUR: Aaauggh.\\nBEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?\\nGALAHAD: Where's that?\\nBEDEVERE: France, I think.\\nLAUNCELOT: Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?\\nARTHUR: No, that's Saint Ives.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, yes.

'Oooooooh', in surprise and alarm.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'!\\nBEDEVERE: Yes, but I-- aaaaaah!\\nARTHUR: Oooh!\\nGALAHAD: My God! [dramatic chord] [roar] \\nMAYNARD: It's the legendary Black Beast of Aaauugh! [Black Beast of Aaauugh eats BROTHER MAYNARD] \\nBEDEVERE: That's it!  That's it!\\nARTHUR: Run away!\\nKNIGHTS: Run away! [roar] Run away!  Run awaaay!  Run awaaaaay! [roar] Keep running! [boom] [roar] Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh! ...\\nBEDEVERE: We've lost him. [roar] \\nKNIGHTS: Aagh!\\nNARRATOR: As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.\\nANIMATOR: Ulk! [thump] \\nNARRATOR: The cartoon peril was no more.  The quest for Holy Grail could continue.\\nSCENE 23: [gurgle] \\nGALAHAD: There it is!\\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death!\\nROBIN: Oh, great.\\nARTHUR: Look!  There's the old man from scene twenty-four!\\nBEDEVERE: What is he doing here?\\nARTHUR: He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.  He asks each traveller five questions--\\nGALAHAD: Three questions.\\nARTHUR: Three questions.  He who answers the five questions--\\nGALAHAD: Three questions.\\nARTHUR: Three questions may cross in safety.\\nROBIN: What if you get a question wrong?\\nARTHUR: Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.\\nROBIN: Oh, I won't go.\\nGALAHAD: Who's going to answer the questions?\\nARTHUR: Sir Robin!\\nROBIN: Yes?\\nARTHUR: Brave Sir Robin, you go.\\nROBIN: Hey!  I've got a great idea.  Why doesn't Launcelot go?\\nLAUNCELOT: Yes.  Let me go, my liege.  I will take him single-handed.  I shall make a feint to the north-east that s--\\nARTHUR: No, no.  No.  Hang on!  Hang on!  Hang on!  Just answer the five questions--\\nGALAHAD: Three questions.\\nARTHUR: Three questions as best you can.  And we shall watch...  and pray.\\nLAUNCELOT: I understand, my liege.\\nARTHUR: Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot.  God be with you.\\nBRIDGEKEEPER: Stop!  Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.\\nLAUNCELOT: Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.\\nBRIDGEKEEPER: What is your name?\\nLAUNCELOT: My name is Sir Launcelot of Camelot.\\nBRIDGEKEEPER: What is your quest?\\nLAUNCELOT: To seek the Holy Grail.\\nBRIDGEKEEPER: What is your favorite color?\\nLAUNCELOT: Blue.\\nBRIDGEKEEPER: Right.

So, you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent running about advancing behaviour?!

Ha ha haaa ha!\\nARTHUR: Walk away.  Just ignore them.\\nFRENCH GUARD: And now, remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!
